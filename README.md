# Project 4: Creating Games

## Introduction

In this project we will use Python to create some classic games we all know and love. There are many to choose from so you can pick your favorites! I have included some games that are a bit more complicated to create, but you don't have to choose those games if they seem too hard. I have only included these for those who have a good amount of experience and would like a larger challenge.

## Objective

Create robust functions to implement games from the following list:

* Easier Games:
  * Rock, Paper, Scissors 
  * Number Guessing Game 
  * Random Password Generator 
  * Mad libs 
  
* Harder Games:
  * Hangman
  * Tic-Tac-Toe

## Project Requirements

You must create either 2 of the easier games or 1 of the harder games list above. Your implementation should be in the form of a function in which it can be ran to play one round of the game. Try to consider as many edge cases as possible so no errors are created due to user input and the game can continue. For example, if you implement the game Rock, Paper, Scissors and the user inputs `Pencil` this should give the user a response that their input was not correct and have them try another input. 

In addition, make sure to call your function and test it out on several examples to ensure the game is running correctly. 

Feel free to create additional functions that you call within your main game function to perform smaller tasks within the game. This could be especially useful for implementing the harder games. 

Please submit your work in a jupyter notebook.

# Description of the Games

Here is a more detailed description of the games listed above for your reference in implementing a solution.

* Rock, Paper, Scissors:

    `def rock_paper_scissors():` is a function that has no inputs. When ran, it asks the user to input either Rock, Paper or Scissors and play against a computer in a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. [Here](https://wrpsa.com/the-official-rules-of-rock-paper-scissors/) is a description of the instructions. The output should let the user know what the computer chose and whether they lost the game. If there is a tie, the user should be asked to input another try and the computer should also generate a new guess.
    
* Number Guessing Game:
  
  `def guessing_game(min, max):` is a function with two inputs: A minimum value and a maximum value. When ran, it asks the user to pick a number between `min` and `max`. If they chose the correct number based on the 'correct' number generated by the computer, they win. If not, the computer should tell them whether the number they chose was greater or less than the correct value and ask them to guess again. They should continune guessing until they get the correct value.

* Random Password Generator:

  `def password_generator():` is a function that has no inputs. When ran, it should output a randomly generated secure password. To be considered a strong password it must have the following requirements:
  * Atleast 12 characters in length
  * 3 uppercase letters from A to Z,
  * 3 lowercase letters from a to z,
  * 3 digits from 0 to 9,
  * 3 characters such as @, !, ?, â€œ, #, <, >, etc.

* Mad libs

  `def mad_libs():` is a function that has no inputs. When ran, it asks the user to input adjectives, nouns, verbs, etc. whatever based on the story you created and the words necessary to complete the story. The output should be the full story with the words inserted that the user input. [Here](https://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~vijaya/ssrvm/worksheetscd/getWorksheets.com/Language%20Arts/madlibsdoc.pdf) are some silly mad libs examples to give you an idea of what they look like if you have never done mad libs before. 

  **Bonus:** You can create multiple mad lib stores and add `story` as an input into your function so that your function works on more than one story!
  
 * Hangman
 
   `def hangman():` is a function that has no inputs. When ran, it tells the user how many letters are in the chosen word and asks them to guess letters. If the letter is in the word, output it placed in the word. If the letter is not in the word, reduce the player's number of guesses by 1. The player should start with 7 guesses that should only decrease if they guess the incorrect letter. Continue the game until the player has guessed all the letters in the word correct and completed the word, or if they run out of guesses. Here is an example:
   
   Word has 6 letters: `_ _ _ `, number of guesses is 7. 
   
   player guesses `t`:
   
   This is in the word so we now output `_ _t`
   
   player guesses `a`:
   
   This is not in the word so their number of guesses should now be 6. 
   
   player guesses `e`:
   
   This is in the word so we now output `_ et`
   
   player guesses `b`:
   
   This is not in the word so their number of guesses should now be 5. 
   
   player guesses `s`:
   
   This is in the word so we now output `set` and the player wins!

   I have uploaded the file `words.txt` which can be used as the selection of possible words to be used in the game. To start the game, you can randomly chose one of these words.
   
* Tic-Tac-Toe
  `def tic_tac_toe():` is a function that has no inputs. When ran, either the user or the computer gets the first move at random and the play begins. Prompt the user to pick a spot when it's their turn and continue play until someone wins or it is a draw. [Here](https://www.exploratorium.edu/brain_explorer/tictactoe.html) are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe if you need a refresher. You can also create the function to have 2 players rather than 1 player and a computer, this is up to you. If you choose 2 players, then the game should prompt each player to enter a location on the board when it is their turn. You do not need to code up an actual board, the game can look like something similar to this by using a matrix or list of lists or however you choose to implement your solution.

## Teams

You will be in groups of 2 for this project. While there are no set requirements on who does which portions of the project, I expect each teammate to do a significant amount of work. I expect you to use the GitHub Flow process in working together and create issues for tasks that need to be done as well as work together in the same .ipynb files. I will be able to tell by the amount of issues, pull requests, commits, code written, etc who is doing what work on the project so make sure you are splitting it up fairly evenly. This is a chance to work as a team, but have the freedom to figure out how to manage the project yourselves. 

## Due Date

This project will be due 11/4 @ 11:59pm.

## Feedback/Grades

The TA will "grade" the project by sending feedback via the team's repo. This does not count towards your final grade and will only act as helpful feedback in building your programming skills, however the project will not be deemed complete unless the above project requirements are complete.
